Run the app in the development mode with `expo start` in the client directory, this will open the expo developer tools page on [http://localhost:19002](http://localhost:19002) in the browser. Scan with your camera of your mobile device the shown QR code and follow the like to open the project in the expo app. 

## 2. Challenge
This challenge should be build with React Native under the use of best practices, architecture and smart use of ES6 features. The [Reddit API](https://api.reddit.com/r/pics/new.json‚Äã) should be used to retrieve the data.

For this challenge the last posts in the r/pics subreddit should be accessed.
